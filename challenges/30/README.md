Go is an language developed by Google to address the specific performance and scalable that they have encountered at their massive software infrastructure.  This language is very “practical” and is being used by Docker, Kubernetes, coreOS’s etcd, rkt and many others.  Often times when people talk about this language, it would say concurrency is the strongest feature.
