12 Days of Commitmas (2014)
====================

Tis the holiday season again, where we relax at home, eat loads of good food and spin driedels. This year, **let's keep learning** all the great stuff learned during the [vBrownbag DevOps sessions](http://professionalvmware.com/vbrownbag-devops-series/).

*Note:* Have an idea for Commitmas? Pull Requests are welcome!

The Challenge
==
Push yourself to use GitHub everyday throughout the holiday season so that by 2015 you're ready to share your next project. Here's how: 

1. Schedule time in your calendar for coding **every day** for the 12 days between December 21st - January 1st
2. Choose your skill level: [Beginner](#beginner), [Intermediate](#intermediate) or [Advanced](#advanced)
3. Follow the directions under your skill level!

That's it! If you get stuck or just want to chat with others, be sure to tweet with the hashtag `#vBrownbag`. We'll be out there to help.


Commit to Your Skill Level
==
We all have different level of expertise when it comes to GitHub. 


##Beginner
<a name="beginner"></a>
*You're a Beginner if:* You're new enough to git that just the act of using it daily will be a lot of learning.

**Setup**:
* Make sure you setup a GitHub account 
* Initialize your own new repository
* Choose the default README file
* Clone your repository to your local development system

**Your challenge**:
* Update the README.md file **every day**
* Add a meaningful comment to your commit
* Push that commit to your GitHub repository

**Helpful hints**:
* Remember that the goal of this is to *learn how to use GitHub*, so focus on git, not other code you'd also like to learn
* Feel free to use the GitHub website, native apps or command line. [Watch this vBB](http://neckbeardinfluence.com/technical-quick-hacking-your-way-into-github/) on GitHub to help you along
* Markdown is awesomely powerful, so challenge yourself to use some of the more complex syntax. [You can learn it all here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)


##Intermediate
<a name="intermediate"></a>
*You're an Intermediate if:* You've created projects in the past, forked other's projects and even offered a pull request or two, but you still feel shaky about the git workflow.

**Setup**:
* Fork an interesting repository that you want to contribute to
* Clone your repository to your local development system
* Create a new branch to develop in

**Your challenge**:
* Update the repository's Master branch **every day** in some way
* On your new branch, work on a meaningful contribution to your fork of the repository
* Add meaningful comments to your commits when you commit on both branches
* Open a Pull Request on the original repository from your new branch by the end of the 12 days of Commitmas!

**Helpful hints**:
* Remember, *documentation is code too!* Find a project you want to support by editing documentation, fork it, and then use it for this challenge


##Advanced
<a name="advanced"></a>
*You're an Advanced if:* You've managed multiple contributor repositories before, have more than 5 pull request accepted, and want to join in Commitmas to really push yourself.

**Setup**:
* You already know how

**Your challenge**:
* Open a new Pull Request on open source repositories you use **every single day** for the 12 days of Commitmas!

**Helpful hints**:
* You really don't need any, but if you complete this challenge, please tell me ([@mjbrender](http://twitter.com/mjbrender)) and I'll definitely buy you a beer
